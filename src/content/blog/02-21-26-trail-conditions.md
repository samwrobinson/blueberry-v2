description: What a winter!!!  8+ inches of fresh snow overnight.  The groomers
  have been busy overnight and this morning, rolling, packing, grooming and
  setting track for your enjoyment.  The trails are magical.  Upland Coffee Cart
  is open, the fire pit is going, the wood stove is warming the back room!  Come
  enjoy and marvel at the beauty of nature in our woods and fields.
