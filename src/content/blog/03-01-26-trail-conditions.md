title: 03/01/26  Trail Conditions

description: "It's a day to choose your skate skis if you have them. The sun is
  shining and 1,2,3 and the west side fields have been tilled 4x around and are
  in great shape. Tracks have not been renovated and reset from yesterday and
  with yesterday's thaw and last night's freeze they run a bit like a luge track
  right now. We are headed out to get 9 tilled right now and then we might try
  to do some laps to get a fresh track in on 1,2,3. Trails 4, 6, 7, 8 and 11
  haven't been touched yet and would be pretty sketchy unless you are super
  confident in your skills. "
