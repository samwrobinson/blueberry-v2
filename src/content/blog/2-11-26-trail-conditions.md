description: WOW!  If there were ever a day to play hookie from work to come
  ski, this would be the day!  Our trails are covered with a fresh 4" layer of
  fresh powder.  Trails 1-4 and 9 are freshly groomed and tracked.  The west
  side trails will be groomed in the late morning after we get the parking lot
  plowed.  Come ski !!!!
