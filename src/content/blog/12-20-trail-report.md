We have spent the last couple of days shoveling snow from place to place trying to get the icy/bare spots covered again on  trails 1,2 and 3. The trail through the woods on three is still a bit of an adventure ski but everything else is thin but very skiable and I would say better than expected. If we get even an inch or two tonight skiing could be quite good tomorrow on 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 11 and the field on 4. Trailsl 6, 7 and 8  remain closed. Currently, the best skiing to be found is the bit of field on 3 & 4 that runs along plunkton road. By morning I bet trail 5, traversing 10 over to Fuller Hill Road and then crossing over to 11 then coming back the same way you came would make for a lovely ski. Please stop in to the center for a full and updated trail report in the morning.  

See you on the trail!
